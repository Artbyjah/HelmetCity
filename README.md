# HelmetCity
"Helmet City" is a cinematic IP inspired by life growing up in Brooklyn, New York, and my childhood TV show, Power Rangers. Using AI, motion capture, and 3D animation, it showcases indie filmmaking. Starting in 2022 with AI-generated content, it earned over $20K on Web3. We're creating a proof-of-concept scene to secure funding for a Film.
